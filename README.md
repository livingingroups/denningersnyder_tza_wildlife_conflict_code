# Code and Data Archive:

This is the code and data repo for internl archiving purposes for the paper [Differentiated drivers in wildlife-induced damage necessitate species-specific mitigation strategies in the western Serengeti, Tanzania](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110202) by Denninger-Snyder et al, 2023. Kate Tiedeman and Brendan Barrett were the MPI affiliated authors.

## Data Cleaning
